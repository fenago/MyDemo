## 3. Typography

Typography is essential for creating a clear, accessible, and branded reading experience. The FAU brand relies on two primary typefaces, Avenir and Superclarendon, to achieve a balance of modern functionality and classic academic appeal.

### 3.1. Primary Typeface: Avenir

Avenir is the workhorse of the FAU brand. Its clean, geometric forms make it highly legible and versatile for a wide range of applications.

-   **Usage**: Recommended for all body copy, subheadings, navigation, and general text content.
-   **Strengths**: High readability, modern aesthetic, and a wide range of weights.

| Weight | Usage Recommendations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Light** | Use for delicate headlines or when a lighter touch is needed. | 
| **Book** | The ideal weight for long-form body text. | 
| **Roman** | A versatile weight for subheadings and general content. | 
| **Heavy** | Best for impactful headlines and calls-to-action. | 

### 3.2. Secondary Typeface: Superclarendon

Superclarendon is a serif typeface that adds a touch of tradition and authority. It should be used sparingly to complement Avenir.

-   **Usage**: Strictly for main page titles (H1) and large, decorative headings in hero sections or designed assets.
-   **Strengths**: Strong personality, classic feel, and high impact.

| Weight | Usage Recommendations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Regular** | Use for standard H1 page titles. | 
| **Bold** | For when an H1 needs extra emphasis. | 
| **Black** | Reserved for high-impact, stylized headlines in graphic lockups. | 

### 3.3. Typographic Hierarchy & Web Implementation

A clear hierarchy ensures content is easy to scan and understand. The following provides a baseline for web development.

| Element | Font Family | Weight | Size (rem) | Line Height | Color | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **H1** | Superclarendon | Regular | 2.5 | 1.2 | #4D4C55 | Page titles only. One per page. |
| **H2** | Avenir | Heavy | 2.0 | 1.3 | #003366 | Main section headings. |
| **H3** | Avenir | Heavy | 1.5 | 1.4 | #CC0000 | Sub-section headings or important callouts. |
| **H4** | Avenir | Roman | 1.25 | 1.5 | #4D4C55 | Minor headings. |
| **Body (p)** | Avenir | Book | 1.0 | 1.6 | #4D4C55 | All general paragraph text. |
| **Link (a)** | Avenir | Roman | 1.0 | 1.6 | #126BD9 | Should be clearly interactive. |
| **Small** | Avenir | Book | 0.875 | 1.5 | #7A97AB | For captions, credits, or tertiary info. |


## 4. Iconography

Iconography provides quick, intuitive visual cues for users. The FAU brand is led by its distinctive owl logo and should be supported by a consistent and clean icon style.

### 4.1. Primary Logo: The Owl

The stylized owl is the centerpiece of the FAU brand. It symbolizes wisdom, determination, and the university's identity.

-   **Usage**: The owl logo should be used as a primary branding mark on all official communications, website headers, and promotional materials.
-   **Treatment**: It is typically rendered in white on an FAU Blue background or in FAU Blue on a white/light gray background. It should always be given adequate clear space and never be altered, stretched, or recolored outside of official guidelines.
-   **Context**: In the provided example, it is used effectively as a profile avatar, reinforcing the individual's affiliation with the university.

### 4.2. General UI Icons

For all other user interface icons (e.g., navigation, alerts, feature callouts), a consistent style should be maintained.

-   **Style**: **Line-based, geometric, and minimalist.** Icons should be simple, clear, and easily recognizable. Avoid overly detailed or illustrative styles.
-   **Weight**: Icon stroke weight should be consistent, typically between 1.5px and 2px, to feel balanced with the Avenir typeface.
-   **Color**: UI icons should typically be rendered in a single color, either **FAU Dark Gray** (#4D4C55) for standard icons or **FAU Electric Blue** (#126BD9) for interactive/clickable icons.
-   **Recommended Icon Set**: A professional, comprehensive set like **Feather Icons** or **Heroicons (Outline)** would align perfectly with this aesthetic. They are open-source and offer a wide range of clean, consistent icons suitable for an academic web presence.



## 5. UI/UX, Layout, and Spacing

A consistent layout and spacing system is crucial for creating a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. The FAU design aesthetic favors a clean, organized, and uncluttered interface.

### 5.1. Layout Principles

-   **Grid System**: A standard 12-column grid is recommended for all page layouts. This provides flexibility for various content types while maintaining structure.
-   **Max Width**: Main content containers should have a maximum width of **1200px** to ensure readability on large screens. Content should be centered within the viewport.
-   **White Space**: Generous use of white space (or negative space) is a key feature. It improves focus, reduces cognitive load, and creates a more professional and academic feel. Do not crowd elements together.

### 5.2. Spacing System (The 8pt Grid)

A consistent spacing system based on an 8pt grid should be used for all margins, padding, and positioning of UI elements. This means all spacing values should be multiples of 8 (e.g., 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px).

| Spacing (px) | Rem (16px base) | Recommended Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 8px | 0.5rem | Small gaps between inline elements. |
| 16px | 1.0rem | Padding within small components (e.g., buttons), gaps between related items. |
| 24px | 1.5rem | Standard component padding (e.g., cards), gaps between distinct UI elements. |
| 32px | 2.0rem | Gaps between larger components or content sections. |
| 48px | 3.0rem | Vertical spacing between major page sections. |
| 64px | 4.0rem | Spacing around hero sections or for significant visual separation. |

### 5.3. Component Styling

Consistent component styling ensures a predictable and cohesive user experience.

#### Buttons

-   **Primary Button**: Solid **FAU Electric Blue** (#126BD9) background, white text, medium padding (e.g., 12px 24px), and a subtle border-radius (e.g., 4px). Use for the main call-to-action on a page.
-   **Secondary Button**: White background, **FAU Electric Blue** (#126BD9) text and border, same padding and radius as primary. Use for secondary actions.
-   **Text Button**: No background or border, **FAU Electric Blue** (#126BD9) text. Use for tertiary actions.

#### Form Inputs

-   **Default State**: A simple, solid 1px border of **FAU Gray** (#CCCCCC) with a white background. Padding should be generous (e.g., 12px).
-   **Focus State**: The border should change to **FAU Electric Blue** (#126BD9) to indicate the active field.
-   **Labels**: Should be placed above the input field and use Avenir Roman.

#### Cards & Containers

-   **Style**: Cards should be clean and simple, using a white background, a subtle border (1px of #EAEAEA or a light box-shadow), and a border-radius of 4px or 8px.
-   **Padding**: Content within cards should have consistent internal padding, typically 24px or 32px.



## 6. Conclusion
